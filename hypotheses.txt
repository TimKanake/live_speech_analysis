hi guys this video is for you who have just started working with solid works %HESITATION I would like to say it at the very beginning of this video that you're going to have a lot of fun working with us suffer because it's a very user friendly and yet capable of doing many many complicated stuff for you and you know in various away so let's just get to it I am when you open solidarity this is going to be the first screen you're gonna see %HESITATION by the way it's %HESITATION to any eleven version two thousand I ever so you may you may have installed or like work with the newer version to a twelve by the I don't have it so sorry for that %HESITATION home when you open the software the program this is the first menu and then just to start you have to either click on this or you see this initially anyway you get three options over here apart from the odd mouse let go with us for now %HESITATION part assembly journey as it sounds up part is just to creating parts somebody just to assemble the parts you have already generated within solidworks or in any other softwares and how important solidworks I'm driving as just an option for you to make %HESITATION to the sketches Judy drawing was out of the first word yes I believe assemblies you just made arm okay I'm gonna make a part but I I did double clicking on the button or just clicking on and then click OK there you %HESITATION this is on the first screen our interface you're gonna buy LC after clicking on the part as you can see %HESITATION there are some on available %HESITATION on this very well one available options over here cheese upon whatever a sorry %HESITATION was that the important things are you stabbed over here features sketch and one other for the initial %HESITATION and this show %HESITATION way when you open southern which I have added these tops %HESITATION later but these are not this is this is an issue just let's focus on on the very basic steps okay if you're gonna start making any part obviously you you're gonna need sketches to the sketches than are men and turn it into three young make your pocket so for that you need to go to the sketch top or here and here you see couple of all different shapes and %HESITATION besides them you see at you see an arrow which even gives you more now I believe he's more sketches %HESITATION so that's up to you what you want now drug important don't forget before any of sketches amber anytime you need a plane you need to define a plane in order to start up sketch in order to draw a sketch okay for that so I will give you really show planes front talking right so we just choose one and click on the sketch road but it's a very basic what method but it's unnecessary but do it for now so you can have a direct view of your skin I play I'm going to draw a rectangle for example this okay that's done and I still see a symbol of a rectangle just next to my %HESITATION crews there most of us so it shows that if I click again and by right clicking I let go with the button drag the mouse and click again %HESITATION it your are you another one if you want to get rid of that symbol just pressed escape %HESITATION button on your keyboard okay as you can see the rectangle we just throw is blue which means and it's under defiant as you can see also here also under defy means that is shaped is still editable and have no reference of being set or fixed the %HESITATION so for doubt you either have to fix it by right clicking on that shape I'm mark click on makes make fixed the or just give some dimensions that I which I'm going to do that on here you see smart dimension on been though that you see on the arrow which gives you many other options which are a little bit less abounds dot smart dimension like for example horizontal dimension only enables you to give dimensions to horizontal lines you cannot define vertical lines but it by deception but if you click on that you can define any kind of mind annual radius or whatever okay so just click on that and I see the symbol of that next summer cruise a mouse and I click on this road coming over here for example click again give a random number for now well on this one as well two hundred there you go I still see the symbol cypress state that's it %HESITATION okay I have the fun too dimensions for me rectangle for the length comfort of it but %HESITATION it's is still in bloom so it should tells you that %HESITATION the location the place up this call rectangle is not defined so for example you wanted you want to have your rectangle exactly at the center of the screen well according to this %HESITATION initial region you have for that you have to love us options either you make a centerline which you don't see your by the way I have added this %HESITATION later which I get a dot and you just go to the line to the arrow click on it center not simply click on and centerline and drawl one just like this this is state right click on it so let me point pull the control key on your keyboard down and pressed the origin now coincidence there you go now you have your kind alert everything all in black %HESITATION which shows you that it's not admissible if you want added them at dimensions you just have to double click on the dimension and changed the mission other than that there's no way okay or if you need if you don't wanna draw an additional line just %HESITATION right click on the line Chris Smith known midpoint suck me point well the comfort you now origin and given give the sketch the vertical relation between these two points to justify do the same for the vertical lines as well horizontal relation as you can see it added your they go it's in black with no extra centerline okay known no let's just get to three deep now I I have to this in black which is none not I'm not it's not a must but it's %HESITATION it's not just that to me fully defined before you go you get to the feature top some you have two options available for now it's true that bus which I'm going to start with I click on it there you go but here that's not important right now you action you see this symbol which can flip aside you're going to extrude your sketch okay and this shows you the type of extrusion you you're going to have one year US gets mind is just law has sounds a just ninety you can just have it as much as you want white changing this number this time will be here in a buzz you to give directions to the extrusion and you want to have on your sketch but you need to have a reference to click on and so we cannot understand which direction you're talking about but for now when you're gonna start you have no do it sorry reference therefore just how are we going to cover the very basic one okay by the way I just need to out home working with my mouse I humbly zooming back to me and and how we were taking the shape just the the tip okay it's really really easy my end the ruler up on your mouse if you just roll it it can zoom in or zoom out and if you want %HESITATION right take the shape just pressed Doug ruler on your mouse in a whole lift and drag your mouse around who really really easy to use copper to other software is our work bit which you have to hold like Kentucky and altogether then drag your mouse and whatever anyway a blunt %HESITATION meet claim which puts your sketch in the middle of the extrusion some up to vertex switching to divert takes we don't have at the moment up to surface I'm gonna cover it upset them separate up to buddy I'm gonna get too often later I'm over here Johnstone off it enables you to deep angles to your %HESITATION three parts as you can see we're here or acquire like that it might at any point click on this %HESITATION Okie but over here you can see the part in like blocks but I'm just anything so I'm not gonna do that just imagine I have okayed that and it's ready okay %HESITATION that's for that imagine you just want to have a half of this and build and half of it really simple so far that you just need to click on the blind therefore you see direction to as well click on that there you go know you're able to change the direction from each side was started change the length of the extruded from each side differently but this and you can angle just once I but this it's really easy on mom holding the ruler in right away and dragging my mouse around and okay that's not but %HESITATION there's one more thing you need to know about extruded bus that's then feature if I just enable that it %HESITATION as you can see just the hall make your part %HESITATION emptiness I so you either put it outside this sketch or a site and like that really just the it just on the option really really helpful either way but it's not really are hard to work with I'm sure you can figure it out okay I'm just gonna have this blood over here and make another block to show you other features up that extra the bus which had mentioned earlier okay I'm going to be John sketch when do I need a plane okay where do I need a plane for example %HESITATION here frankly okay this menu press on the space bar on the keyboard and he pops up pops out anywhere and it's really helpful you can see I watch your block your part from any angle you want %HESITATION I just I just need done normal to okay I'm going to make another sketch by going to the sketch stop making %HESITATION like I'm going to draw a circle but this press this game button to get me that that Simone smart dimension but for example that's so seven is good no I'm going to extradite this but this time %HESITATION not going to use the metal blind %HESITATION gonna show you the other options through all just %HESITATION makes it %HESITATION extruded through all of the park like if you had your part to hear that circle without well mixture that appear %HESITATION up to surface you just need to define the surface sorrow that circle is a extranet till that we're takes you need to it's on the road more complicated you need to define a vertex first then you can not just that I give give %HESITATION that but that that's a reference stood firm surface just need to define the surface over here and typed in dimension you want it you you want it to be offset from like this it's eight fifty millimeters offset from this plane not direction if you want a change of direction of rivers love sex but this now fifty millimeters from this okay and up to body you need to have another body just to like this works pretty much the same are they find that and it would be a but he's
